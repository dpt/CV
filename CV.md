**The Great Escape** (2012+)  
  Reverse engineering Denton Designs’ classic 1986 ZX Spectrum game “The Great Escape”.

  Decoding the game image, locating all of the textual, graphical and map data then reverse engineering all of the Z80 assembly functions until the game logic can be explained.

  I’ve then proceeded to reimplement the game as portable C code, currently for macOS and Windows.
